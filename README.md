# RepoMind
A plug-and-play AI-powered support assistant that integrates seamlessly with any software repository. When a repository is built, this assistant is built alongside it, providing intelligent monitoring and proactive support. It understands the repositoryâ€™s code, runtime behavior, system performance (heap, stack, memory, CPU usage).
