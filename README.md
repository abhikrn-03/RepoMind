# RepoMind
a plug-and-play AI-powered support assistant that integrates seamlessly with any software repository. When a repository is built, this assistant is built alongside it, providing intelligent monitoring and proactive support. It understands the repository’s code, runtime behavior, system performance (heap, stack, memory, CPU usage), and user interactions. Equipped with a dedicated support channel, it detects crashes, diagnoses issues, and even suggests or implements fixes—enhancing both developer efficiency and user experience. The assistant may also include a UI for deeper insights and management.
